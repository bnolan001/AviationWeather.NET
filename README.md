# AviationWeather.NET
AviationWeather.NET provides a simple interface to access METAR and TAF weather data from the AviationWeather.gov Dataserver,  https://aviationweather.gov/dataserver.  The library parses the CSV and XML formats generated by the dataserver and returns a structured object to the caller.

Currently working through the initial implementation of the library.  This project is in Alpha development.
